FUNCTIONS

Function calls:
- Figure out a way for create LoxCallable: create an instance from a child class, 
and a parent class to extend?

Native functions:
- in Interpreter() method: define the clock 'native' function, defineEnvironemt(?) -> give a name and an 
anonymous instance of the LoxCallable, and overwrite everything (arity, call, toString?)

Function declaration:
- in Parser: create function declaration and its own AST node (takes the name, params, body)
 (created in function method)

Function objects:
- new class LoxFunction extends LoxCallable --> figure out what to do
LoxFunction takes constructor with a param, and overwrites call in which it creates a new environemt.
